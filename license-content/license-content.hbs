<h2>{{productName}} licenses</h2>

<p>{{productName}} has three kinds of licenses: open-source, commercial, and OEM.</p>

{{! ----------------------------------------------------------------- }}

<h3>Open source license</h3>

<p>The open source license is designed for you to use {{productName}} to build open source and personal projects. The {{productName}} open source license is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3</a>. The GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important is how <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#section5">it is <em>sticky</em> when you distribute your work publicly</a>. From the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">GPL FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Releasing your project that uses {{productName}} under the GPLv3, in turn, requires your project to be licensed under the GPLv3. If you are okay with this, feel free to use {{productName}} under the GPLv3, without purchasing a commercial license.</p>

{{! ----------------------------------------------------------------- }}

<h3>Commercial license</h3>

<p>The commercial license is designed to for you to use {{productName}} in commercial products and applications, without the provisions of the GPLv3. With the commercial license, your code is kept propietary, to yourself. If you want to use {{productName}} to develop commercial sites, themes, projects, and applications, the commercial license is the appropriate license.</p>

<h3>Purchasing a commercial license</h3>

<p>Purchasing takes a minute. Our purchasing form accepts credit cards or PayPal. Once purchased, you&rsquo;ll receive a commercial license PDF and you will be all set to use {{productName}} in your commercial applications. With the purchase of a commercial license:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may use {{productName}} in as many commercial applications you like.</li>
  <li>You may use {{productName}} in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium WordPress, Tumblr, or other CMS themes, plugins and templates.</li>
  <li>Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license &mdash; so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with {{productName}}.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commercial Licenses are priced per team member. A team member is someone on your team working on a project that uses {{productName}}.</p>
